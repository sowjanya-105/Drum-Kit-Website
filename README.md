# Drum-Kit-Website 🥁

The Drum Kit is a simple project developed using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. The user can generate different kinds of music and enjoy the sound of their music. The user can click the different drum sets or even press the respective buttons and enjoy generating different tunes. 

I worked on this project as a part of my Web Development course by Ms. Angela Yu.
